# Coding Exercises in JavaScript

These are coding exercises I've been doing to keep the *momentum*.

## Running

I've developed these files using macOS, Node.js and VS Code.

You can run them by doing

1. `./filename.js` (I suggest to use `chmod` to make sure it is executable)
2. `node filename.js`
3. running from inside VS Code (see below)

## Setting VS Code for debugging and running (my preferred)

1. Activate Node debugging in `Code` / `Preferences` / `Settings`
   1. search for `node debug`
   2. set `Debug > Node: Auto Attach` to `on`
2. Set VS Code to run the scripts in `Debug` / `Open Configurations`
   1. select `Node.js`
   2. it will create a folder `.vscode` and add a `launch.json`

Now, it's possible to run the scripts from inside VS Code, debugging (F5) or not (^F5)

## Disclaimer

All code here is merely result of exercises strictly considering the requirements. They are not optimized nor production ready.
